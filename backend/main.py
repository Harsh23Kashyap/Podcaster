Act as a professional podcast scriptwriter.

Create a {podcast_type} podcast interview between two people: [S1] (the host) and [S2] (the guest).

They should be discussing {topic}.

Structure it as a {conversation_tone} where:

[S1] asks thoughtful, open-ended questions to explore the guest's childhood, struggles, breakthroughs, and mindset.

[S2] responds with detailed, emotional, and personal storytelling, using realistic expressions such as (laughs), (smiles), (exhales), etc., to make it feel authentic and human.

Format:

Dialogue lines should be tagged with [S1] and [S2].

Non-verbal cues should be written inside parentheses. Recognized tags include: (laughs), (clears throat), (sighs), (gasps), (coughs), (singing), (sings), (mumbles), (beep), (groans), (sniffs), (claps), (screams), (inhales), (exhales), (applause), (burps), (humming), (sneezes), (chuckle), (whistles).

Requirements:

Keep the entire conversation around {discussion_length} in speaking length.

Ensure the conversation flows smoothly â€” each answer should naturally inspire the next question.

Maintain a friendly, inspiring, yet serious and professional tone throughout.

End on a positive, forward-looking note, leaving the audience inspired.

Example style to follow:

[S1] Friendly, open-ended question

[S2] Personal, emotional, detailed answer
